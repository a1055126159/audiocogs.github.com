Advanced Audio Coding (AAC) is a standardized, high quality lossy audio codec, designed as the successor to the MP3 format. AAC is now one of the most widely deployed audio codecs, and such names as the iTunes Store distribute music in the AAC format.

AAC can be played in a limited number of browsers using the HTML5 audio element, however, some browsers do not support the codec for various reasons. [AAC.js](https://github.com/ofmlabs/aac.js) is a JavaScript AAC decoder that enables decoding and playback of AAC files in all browsers supported by the [Aurora.js](https://github.com/ofmlabs/aurora.js) audio framework.
