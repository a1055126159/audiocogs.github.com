The [Free Lossless Audio Codec](http://flac.sourceforge.net) (FLAC) is a widely used lossless audio codec, 
which means that the audio is compressed without any loss of quality. A decoded FLAC stream is bit-for-bit identical 
to the original uncompressed audio file.

[FLAC.js](http://github.com/audiocogs/flac.js) is a JavaScript FLAC decoder based on the implementation found in the 
[FFmpeg project](http://ffmpeg.org/).
